In this work, we implemented the discontinuous Galerkin method into \sfepy{}
package. \sfepy{} uses a term based syntax for building discretizations of
equations. We implemented several new terms, namely the linear advection flux
term, the general hyperbolic flux term, the diffusion flux and the diffusion
penalty terms, and the general term for computing the integral
$$
\int_{T^k} \vec{f}(P_i^k\psi_i)\cdot\nabla\psi_j.
$$
Along with a wide range of terms already present in \sfepy{} this allows users
to discretize a variety of useful equations. To enable solving transient
equations we implemented two explicit time-stepping solvers, the forward Euler
solver and the TVD Runge-Kutta of the 3rd order solver. Moreover, we
implemented the moment limiters for 1D and 2D transient problems.

To study properties of the method we measured convergence rates for seven
example problems chosen from the literature. For some of them, we present
results which complement already published parametric studies. For transient
problems, the performance of the method is hindered by used time stepping
solvers, nevertheless, the method still performs to the expectations.

This fulfills all the major goals of this work. There are, however, still many
possible improvements and opportunities for future work. Although from the
time and memory requirements perspective the implementation of the method
scales well enough with \sfepy{} capabilities, there is still room for
improvement. Calls of \pysauce{numpy.einsum} could use an optimized tensor
contraction path, which could be retained between individual term evaluations
(i.e., between time steps). The implementation of limiters is rather ad-hoc and
refactoring it to bring it in line with the design of other \sfepy{} elements
would help to make their code more readable and their usage simpler and more
versatile. 

One important feature available in \sfepy{} missing from this DG FEM
implementation is the ability to solve systems of PDEs. This lack could inspire
future work as it would require substantial modification of flux terms as well
as the implementation of strategies for evolving systems of interest like Euler
or Navier-Stokes equations \cite{Hesthaven2008}. Further besides the
implemented Lax-Friedrichs flux, there is a variety of other fluxes for example
the Godunov flux \cite{DiPietro2012} or fluxes designed specifically for
solving Euler equations \cite[Section 3.3]{Kucera} which could be added to
broaden the selection of tools available in \sfepy{}. Thanks to the versatility
of the problem specification this would also unlock a large potential for
further study of the method behavior.
