We derive a discontinuous Galerkin formulation for a model scalar convection-diffusion equa- tion with nonlinear convection and diffusion. The resulting symmetric, nonsym- metric and incomplete variants are theoretically analyzed and error estimates in the L2(H1)- and L∞(L2)-norms are derived. Since these error estimates are suboptimal in the latter norm, we use the Aubin-Nitsche technique to obtain L∞(L2)-optimal estimates. The proof admits nonconforming meshes, however this result is limited to the symmetric variant and linear diffusion. Numerical experiments are performed to verify these theoretical results by the experimental order of convergence. Further, we apply the discontinuous Galerkin method to the compressible Euler equations using a semi-implicit discretization with respect to time. We discuss the choice of boundary conditions and shock capturing. Several numerical examples show the resulting scheme is capable of computing transonic, supersonic and low-Mach flows. Finally, we treat the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, incorporating viscous terms into the semi-implicit numerical scheme for the Euler equations. The extension of the discontinuous Galerkin formulation of second order terms to systems of equations is discussed and a new approach is derived. Several numerical examples for the Navier-Stokes equations are pre- sented.},

The method is explicit in the sense that the solution can be developed one element at a time. We derive the method formally and show how to con- struct aMatlab program to run the method on a tensor product mesh with vertical edges and bilinear elements. Unfortunately numerical experiments give evidence that the method is unstable for any choice of parameters. This is further investigated in a von Neumann stability analysis which results in strong (numerical) evidence that the method is unconditionally unstable - at least for this certain type of trial-/testspace. A possible remedy could be to use a mesh that avoids vertical edges (ex- cept on the boundary). This is required in somewhat similar, but successful (non-IP) DG-methods, [1, 2, 3].},

DGFEMs was chosen as a numerical method due to its stability, robustnesses, and mainly because the method is very suitable for parallelization due to a large degree of locallity and intensive arithmetic operations. It is well known that the time used to run and get results from a code increases as we use more elements in the DGFEMs. The aim of this work is to develop a CUDA code for an Elliptic Problem in 1D using DGFEMs to reduce this time and, compare its performance with its counterpart in serial. At the end of the work some benchmarks were performed to show that the code in parallel is much faster than the code in serial.},

@article{Chalons2018,
abstract = {This paper focuses on the numerical approximation of the solutions of non-local conservation laws in one space dimension. These equations are motivated by two distinct applications, namely a traffic flow model in which the mean velocity depends on a weighted mean of the downstream traffic density, and a sedimentation model where either the solid phase velocity or the solid-fluid relative velocity depends on the concentration in a neighborhood. In both models, the velocity is a function of a convolution product between the unknown and a kernel function with compact support. It turns out that the solutions of such equations may exhibit oscillations that are very difficult to approximate using classical first-order numerical schemes. We propose to design Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes and Finite Volume WENO (FV-WENO) schemes to obtain high-order approximations. As we will see, the DG schemes give the best numerical results but their CFL condition is very restrictive. On the contrary, FV-WENO schemes can be used with larger time steps. We will see that the evaluation of the convolution terms necessitates the use of quadratic polynomials reconstructions in each cell in order to obtain the high-order accuracy with the FV-WENO approach. Simulations using DG and FV-WENO schemes are presented for both applications.},

Possible reasons for this are the flexibility in local approximation they offer, together with their good stability properties when approximating convection-dominated problems. Owing to their interpretation both as Galerkin projections onto suitable energy (native) spaces and, simultaneously, as high order versions of classical upwind finite volume schemes, they offer a range of attractive properties for the numerical solution of various classes of PDE problems where classical fi- nite element methods under-perform, or even fail.

abstract = {We discuss the discretisation using discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation of an elliptic Poisson problem. Two commonly used DG schemes are investigated: the original average flux proposed by Bassi and Rebay [1] and the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) [2] scheme. In this paper we expand on previous expositions [3, 4, 5] by adopting a matrix based notation with a view to highlighting the steps required in a numerical implementation of the DG method. Through consideration of standard C 0-type expansion bases, as opposed to elementally * 1 orthogonal expansions, with the matrix formulation we are able to apply static condensation techniques to improve efficiency of the direct solver when high order expansions are adopted. The use of C 0-type expansions also permits the direct enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions through a "lifting" approach where the LDG flux does not require further stabilisation. In our construction we also adopt a formulation of the continuous DG fluxes that permits a more general interpretation of their numerical implementation. In particular it allows us to determine the conditions under which conditions the LDG method provides a near local stencil. Finally a study of the conditioning and the size of the null space of the matrix systems resulting from the DG discretisation of the elliptic problem is undertaken.},

abstract = {In this paper, we review the development of the Runge–Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) methods for non-linear convection-dominated problems. These robust and accurate methods have made their way into the main stream of computational fluid dynamics and are quickly finding use in a wide variety of applications. They combine a special class of Runge–Kutta time discretizations, that allows the method to be non-linearly stable regardless of its accuracy, with a finite element space discretization by discontinuous approximations, that incorporates the ideas of numerical fluxes and slope limiters coined during the remarkable development of the high-resolution finite difference and finite volume schemes. The resulting RKDG methods are stable, high-order accurate, and highly parallelizable schemes that can easily handle complicated geometries and boundary conditions. We review the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of these methods and show several applications including nonlinear conservation laws, the compressible and incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, and Hamilton–Jacobi- like equations.},

  abstract = {The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is frequently used in computational fluid dynamics for its stability and high order of accuracy. A disadvantage of the DG method is its high computational demands. The aim of this paper is to weaken this drawback by means of parallelization of the DG algorithm. The computation is performed on a network of computers with distributed memory using the Java Remote Method Invocation, which is included in the Java programming language. The partition of the boundary value problem into n subproblems, which is then solved by n computers separately, is based on the overlapping Schwarz method. On basis of physical nature of the problem, the present paper proposes minimal size of the overlap that allows for only one Schwarz iteration thereby increasing efficiency of parallelization. The scalability and efficiency of the presented parallelization approach is demonstrated on several test problems. In order to stabilize the DG method in presence of shocks, a recently developed technique by Huerta et al. (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Fluids 69(10), 2012, 1614–1632), which introduces discontinuities in basis functions in regions with a shock, is adopted here. A modification of this approach, which lowers the computational and implementational demands, is presented here.},

  abstract      = {High-order numerical methods for unstructured grids combine the superior accuracy of high-order spectral or finite difference methods with the geometric flexibility of low-order finite volume or finite element schemes. The Flux Reconstruction (FR) approach unifies various high-order schemes for unstructured grids within a single framework. Additionally, the FR approach exhibits a significant degree of element locality, and is thus able to run efficiently on modern streaming architectures, such as Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). The aforementioned properties of FR mean it offers a promising route to performing affordable, and hence industrially relevant, scale-resolving simulations of hitherto intractable unsteady flows within the vicinity of real-world engineering geometries. In this paper we present PyFR, an open-source Python based framework for solving advection–diffusion type problems on streaming architectures using the FR approach. The framework is designed to solve a range of governing systems on mixed unstructured grids containing various element types. It is also designed to target a range of hardware platforms via use of an in-built domain specific language based on the Mako templating engine. The current release of PyFR is able to solve the compressible Euler and Navier–Stokes equations on grids of quadrilateral and triangular elements in two dimensions, and hexahedral elements in three dimensions, targeting clusters of CPUs, and NVIDIA GPUs. Results are presented for various benchmark flow problems, single-node performance is discussed, and scalability of the code is demonstrated on up to 104 NVIDIA M2090 GPUs.
